#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment

<u> <b>Description:</b></u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
 The simulator has a package of lab equipments like voltmeter, ammeters, rheostat, single-phase transformer and wires. Firstly, Student must perform open circuit test after that student will able to perform short circuit test. Before performing the experiments, user has to understand the equivalent circuit of experiments and make proper connections to complete the circuit as per the given instructions. After making the right connection, the user can ready to take a reading from ammeter, voltmeter and wattmeter at rated input supply. These observation readings are used to calculate the transformer parameter and their no-load and full-load losses.
